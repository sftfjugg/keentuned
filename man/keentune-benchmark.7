.SH NAME
keentune-benchmark - description of basic keentune benchmark

.SH DESCRIPTION
Benchmark needs two files, one is the benchmark script and the other is the benchmark conf file.

The benchmark script file defines how to run the benchmark tool, accept the output of the benchmark tool, and parse the output results. Benchmark script file is saved under the /etc/keentune/benchmark/.

The benchmark conf file is defined in the fields in the json file.

.SH BENCHMARK
At the moment we provide the following pre-defined benchmark:

.TP
.BI "wrk"
Wrk is a more advanced HTTP stress testing tool that is capable of generating a heavy load when run on a single multi-core CPU.

.TP
.BI "iperf"
Iperf3 is a bandwidth testing tool that supports the adjustment of various parameters such as communication protocol, number of packets, transmission duration, reporting of network bandwidth, packet loss rate, and other parameters.

.TP
.BI "tpce"
TPC-E tests the OLTP performance of the database by simulating the secure transaction of financial firms. The TPC-E test focuses more on the database for processing related transactions from financial firms and their customer accounts.

.TP
.BI "tpch"
TPC-H evaluates the decision support capability of a specific query, mainly for the capability of the server in data mining and analysis processing tasks. TPC-H is commonly used for measuring the ability of 
a newly developed database system to provide query decision support.

.TP
.BI "fio"
The fio is an IO test tool that can run on Linux, Windows, and can be used to test the performance of local disk, networked storage, etc.
Fio supports flexible configuration, multi-client concurrent testing (server, client mode), and file-level, object-level storage testing.
